# SeventhChallenge

This project was made for the seventh challenge of Applaudo Studio's Trainee Program.

It's an angular project, divided in two main sectiosn;

    The Profiles section, which provides a github profiles searcher, allowing the user to search for a profile, and display its info, including repositories and followers, both with corresponding pagination.

    The form section, which consists of a form, with validation, done with reactive forms, which upon proper submission prints its values to the console, and displays them in a modal for the user to see.

Also, the project has a simple footer, and a navbar with primitive routing capabilities.
